Description: The 'dpmixsim' package implements a Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM)
        model for clustering and image segmentation.  The DPM model is
        a Bayesian nonparametric methodology that relies on MCMC
        simulations for exploring mixture models with an unknown number
        of components.  The code implements conjugate models with
        normal structure (conjugate normal-normal DP mixture model).
        The package's applications are oriented towards the
        classification of magnetic resonance images according to tissue
        type or region of interest.
